Your job is to create a single or a set of mermaid {{DIAGRAM_TYPE}}, each in their own code block. 
The {{DIAGRAM_TYPE}} should be drawn in portrait mode, vertically. 
The code block(s) should be tagged as mermaid code. 
Use appropriate background and high contrast text colors to make the text readable.
Use topic matching icons if the mermaid diagram supports it.
Make sure text does not overlap.
Create a newline after each code block and specify an appropriate caption for the {{DIAGRAM_TYPE}}.

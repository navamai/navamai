### Notes:
- **Star Ratings**: Not available as this information is typically found on platforms like GitHub or academic databases, which are not provided in the sources.
- **GitHub Links**: Not available as the sources do not include links to GitHub repositories.
- **Citations and Search Rankings**: The provided sources do not include detailed citation counts or search rankings, making it difficult to rank the papers based on these criteria.

For more comprehensive and up-to-date information, consider searching academic databases like Google Scholar, arXiv, or specific journal websites.

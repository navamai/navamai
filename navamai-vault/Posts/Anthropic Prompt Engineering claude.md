Here is a numbered list of prompt engineering tips based on the transcript, ranked from most to least important:

1. Clearly communicate instructions and context to the model, as if explaining to an educated layperson who is unfamiliar with the specific task.

2. Read and analyze model outputs carefully to understand how the model is interpreting and responding to prompts.

3. Iterate and experiment extensively, trying many variations to find what works best.

4. Consider edge cases and potential failure modes when designing prompts, not just the typical use case.

5. Provide examples to illustrate the desired output, but be careful not to overly constrain the model.

6. Use chain-of-thought prompting to encourage step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks.

7. Give the model relevant background information or references (e.g. academic papers) rather than oversimplifying.

8. Ask the model to explain its reasoning or identify ambiguities in the instructions.

9. Use metaphors or analogies to help frame tasks in a way the model can understand.

10. Leverage the model's ability to take on different personas or roles when appropriate for the task.

11. Pay attention to prompt formatting, grammar, and style, but don't obsess over minor details.

12. Consider using the model itself as a prompting assistant to help refine and improve prompts.

13. For enterprise use cases, thoroughly test prompts across a wide range of potential inputs.

14. Explore the boundaries of the model's capabilities to better understand its strengths and limitations.

15. Be willing to define new concepts or frameworks to precisely communicate what you want from the model.

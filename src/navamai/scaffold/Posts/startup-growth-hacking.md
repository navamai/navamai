# Pieter Levels on Hacking Startups Quickly

1. Build with technology you already know. Don't spend time learning new frameworks if you can ship faster with what you're familiar with.
2. Start with a minimum viable product (MVP) and launch quickly, within weeks if possible. Iterate based on user feedback.
3. Focus on solving real problems people have and are willing to pay for. Look for pain points in your own life or industry.
4. Use crowdsourcing and user-generated content to build products cheaply and quickly.
5. Automate as much as possible to keep costs low and scale efficiently. Use cron jobs, scripts, and AI to handle repetitive tasks.
6. Charge money from the beginning. Free users often don't convert well. Aim for at least $30/month per user to make it worthwhile.
7. Use off-the-shelf solutions like Stripe for payments to get up and running fast.
8. Launch on platforms like ProductHunt, Hacker News, and social media to get initial traction.
9. Be open to pivoting if the initial idea doesn't work. Keep iterating until you find product-market fit.
10. Consider B2B models like job boards which can charge higher prices.
11. Use AI and new technologies to create novel products quickly, but focus on solving real user needs.
12. Don't obsess over perfection. Ship fast and improve based on user feedback.
13. Be willing to do things manually at first before automating. This helps you understand the process better.
14. Look for arbitrage opportunities - ideas that work in one market/country that could be applied elsewhere.
15. Build in public and leverage Twitter/social media to gain an audience and early adopters.

## Prompt Engineering Strategies

1. **Write clear instructions**: Provide detailed and specific instructions to get more relevant answers.
2. **Provide reference text**: Supply trusted information to help the model answer accurately.
3. **Split complex tasks**: Break down complicated tasks into simpler subtasks for better results.
4. **Give the model time to "think"**: Allow the model to work through problems step-by-step.
5. **Use external tools**: Leverage additional resources to complement the model's capabilities.
6. **Test changes systematically**: Evaluate modifications to ensure improvements in performance.

## Tactics for Clear Instructions

1. **Include details in queries**: Offer specific context to get more relevant responses.
2. **Adopt personas**: Ask the model to take on a specific role for tailored responses.
3. **Use delimiters**: Clearly separate different parts of the input for better understanding.
4. **Specify steps**: Provide a sequence of steps for the model to follow.
5. **Provide examples**: Demonstrate the desired output format or style.
6. **Specify output length**: Request a particular length for the model's response.

## Tactics for Reference Text

1. **Answer using reference**: Instruct the model to use provided information for responses.
2. **Answer with citations**: Ask the model to cite passages from the reference text.

## Tactics for Splitting Complex Tasks

1. **Use intent classification**: Identify relevant instructions based on query type.
2. **Summarize long conversations**: Condense previous dialogue for extended conversations.
3. **Recursive summarization**: Summarize long documents piece by piece, then combine summaries.

## Tactics for Giving Time to "Think"

1. **Work out own solution**: Instruct the model to solve problems before evaluating others' solutions.
2. **Use inner monologue**: Hide the model's reasoning process using structured formats.
3. **Ask for missed information**: Prompt the model to find additional relevant information.

## Tactics for External Tools

1. **Use embeddings-based search**: Implement efficient knowledge retrieval for relevant information.
2. **Execute code**: Perform accurate calculations or call external APIs using code execution.
3. **Access specific functions**: Utilize the Chat Completions API for function calling.

## Tactics for Systematic Testing

1. **Evaluate against gold-standard**: Compare model outputs to known correct answers for assessment.
